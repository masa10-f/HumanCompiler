## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: Can I evaluate HumanCompiler before purchasing a commercial license?

**A:** Yes! You can use the AGPL-3.0 version for evaluation purposes. We also offer a 30-day trial period for commercial licenses.

### Q2: What happens if I start with AGPL-3.0 and later want a commercial license?

**A:** You can upgrade to a commercial license at any time. Your previous use under AGPL-3.0 remains compliant, and future use will be under the commercial terms.

### Q3: Can I use HumanCompiler internally without disclosing source code?

**A:** Under AGPL-3.0, if you provide the software as a network service (even internally), you must provide source code to users. A commercial license removes this requirement.

### Q4: Is the commercial license perpetual or subscription-based?

**A:** We offer both options. Perpetual licenses include 1 year of support and updates, with optional renewal. Subscription licenses include continuous support and updates.

### Q5: Can I get a refund if the commercial license doesn't meet my needs?

**A:** Yes, we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for commercial licenses.

### Q6: Do you offer source code escrow?

**A:** Yes, for Enterprise Plan customers, we provide source code escrow services to protect your investment.
