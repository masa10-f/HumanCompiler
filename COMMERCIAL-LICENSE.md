## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: Can I evaluate HumanCompiler before purchasing a commercial license?

**A:** Yes! You can use the AGPL-3.0 version for evaluation purposes. Commercial license trial programs are still being planned.

### Q2: What happens if I start with AGPL-3.0 and later want a commercial license?

**A:** You can upgrade to a commercial license at any time. Your previous use under AGPL-3.0 remains compliant, and future use will be under the commercial terms.

### Q3: Can I use HumanCompiler internally without disclosing source code?

**A:** Under AGPL-3.0, if you provide the software as a network service (even internally), you must provide source code to users. A commercial license removes this requirement.

**A:** We are still evaluating both perpetual and subscription-based models. Please contact us to discuss your preferred licensing model.

### Q5: When will commercial licenses be available?

**A:** The commercial licensing program is currently under development. We welcome early inquiries to help us prioritize features and pricing that meet customer needs.
